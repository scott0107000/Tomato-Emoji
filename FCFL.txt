FREE FOR COMMERCIAL USE FONT LICENSE VERSION 1.0 - 01 DECEMBER 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 0. PREAMBLE
Free For Commercial Use Font License (FCFL) is a font license that is targetted for generic font authors/foundries to provide a written license such that the agreement can be made permanently without the risk of retracting.

This license strongly encourages font authors/foundries to use the newest version of "SIL Open Font License (SIL OFL)" which is a collaborative font licensing solution that can support more font authors/foundries to create free and open-source fonts. Authors/font foundries are encourages to switch to SIL OFL from this license as soon as possible.

The FCFL allows the licensed font to only be used for personal and commercial uses as listed below. Any fonts may be licensed under this license, but if the author agrees for any derivative works to be made, the font licensed under this license and all its derivative works must be released under SIL OFL and not under any other type of license. This is to stimulate further developments of collaborative font projects under a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others. The requirement for derivative works using the licensed fonts to use SIL OFL does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
